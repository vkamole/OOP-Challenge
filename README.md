## About the Project

The **Pet Simulator** is a Python-based program designed to simulate the experience of owning and interacting with a virtual pet. It uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create a `Pet` class with attributes and methods that allow users to perform various actions with their pet.

This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates the use of:

- **Classes and objects**
- **Methods and attributes**
- **User input handling**
- **Loops and conditional statements**
- **Basic error handling**
